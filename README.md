README - Getting and Cleaning Data Project 

This is my repository (getcleandata) for the 'Getting and Cleaning Data' project assignment for the Coursera course.

The repository contains the following files, besides the README you are currently in:
* run_analysis.R    - The finalized script to obtain the Tiny data file based on the input-DataSet
* Codebook.md       - Additional information about the Data (Variables, transformations, etc.)

The DataSet used in this project can be obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Platform:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The DataSet can directly be obtained from:

And, should be credited to:
* [1] Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

Guidelines for the project in general:  You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
*  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
*  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
*  5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
