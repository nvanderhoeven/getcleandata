This codebook describes the steps for the data thas was obtained, creating a tidy data set,
based on the DataSet obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Platform (also see the ReadMe file in this repository)

The data can be obtained from:

In the DataSet, there is the 'actual' data (available in .txt files):
* Test Data: X_test, y_test and subject_test
* Train Data: X_train, y_train and subject_train

And, the descriptive files to the data (available in .txt files):
* Features (and, Features_info)
* Activity_labels 
* README

The run_analysis.R script tries to achieve the following:
* Download and unzip the Dataset (lines 13-22 of the coding)
* The respective test/train data is read (read table, lines 33-57 of the coding)
  The indices corresponding to mean values and standard deviation are obtained for subsetting by 
  selecting variables which contain mean or std (i.e. "mean|std). (line 37 of the coding)
* Combining the two subsets into one set (lines 65-68 of the coding)
* Merge the test and train data into one finalized tidy .txt file. (line 71-73 of the coding)

The naming in the final tidy .txt file is similar to the naming convention of the source data.
* The first two columns are obtained from the Activity_labels .txt file.
  i.e. the first column is related to the Subject (e.g., 1, 2, 3) related to the actual
  Activity (e.g., walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs)
  
* The other columns correspond to values describing mean / standard deviations obtained
  from the Test / Train dataset. The naming of these variables is the same as in the Features text file.
  e.g.: BodyGyro-mean()-Y, tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z
